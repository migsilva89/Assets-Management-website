# Assets Management Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The Assets Management Website is a full-featured application built with Next.js that allows users to easily manage their
digital assets such as images and text. With integration to the Assets Management API, users can store, categorize, tag,
and search their assets with ease. The website offers a clean and intuitive user interface, enabling users to easily
view, edit, and delete their assets. Additionally, the website includes a real-time chat feature, allowing users to
collaborate and communicate with each other in real-time. The website is secured with authentication and authorization
using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring that users' data is kept safe and secure.

## Acknowledgments

This website was developed as a practical application of the Assets Management API, which was built as part of the
Full-Stack Web Development course at Flag.pt. Special thanks to our instructor, Fernando, for providing valuable
guidance and support during the course. Additionally, I would like to thank my fellow classmates for their feedback and
suggestions during the development of this website.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js: A popular React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-defined styles and classes for quickly building
  responsive
  web designs.
- Axios: A popular HTTP client library for making API requests from the browser.
- Socket.io-client: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and the client
  using
  WebSockets.
- Jsonwebtoken: for generating and verifying JWTs

## Development

**To set up the development environment:**

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js installed on your machine
-

1. Clone the repository

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/migsilva89/Dev-Assets-Pro-website
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed
on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited
in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated
as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and
load Inter, a custom Google Font.
