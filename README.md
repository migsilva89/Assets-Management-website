# Assets Management Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The Assets Management Website is a full-featured application built with Next.js that allows users to easily manage their
digital assets such as images and text. With integration to
the [Assets Management API](https://github.com/migsilva89/Dev-Assets-Pro-Api), users can store, categorize, tag,
and search their assets with ease. The website offers a clean and intuitive user interface, enabling users to easily
view, edit, and delete their assets. Additionally, the website includes a real-time chat feature, allowing users to
collaborate and communicate with each other in real-time. The website is secured with authentication and authorization
using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring that users' data is kept safe and secure.

## Acknowledgments

Full-Stack Web Development course at Flag.pt. Special thanks to our instructor, Fernando, for providing valuable
guidance and support during the course. Additionally, I would like to thank my fellow classmates for their feedback and
suggestions during the development of this website.
